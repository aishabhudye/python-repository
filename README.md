Python Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of Python projects that explore fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, arrays, and a main project: a console-based Tic Tac Toe game.

Projects Overview
Basic Python Concepts:

Demonstrates basic Python programming concepts like functions, arrays, and loops.
Tic Tac Toe Game:

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game.
Allows two players to play alternately by specifying positions on a 3x3 grid.
Validates input and ensures no duplicate or invalid moves.
Detects and announces the winner when a row, column, or diagonal is formed.

Features
Input validation to ensure correct values and positions.
Real-time board updates after each move.
Detection of winning combinations (row, column, diagonal).
Full board check for a draw.

Technologies
Python: All projects are implemented in Python.
Future Enhancements
Implement a graphical interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
Add AI for single-player mode.
