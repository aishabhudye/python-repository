Python Projects Repository
This repository contains a variety of Python projects that demonstrate core programming concepts such as arrays, loops, input validation, and object-oriented programming. The main projects include a Tic Tac Toe game and a Caesar Cipher encryption tool.

Projects Overview
Basic Python Concepts:

Demonstrates foundational Python programming principles like arrays, loops, and functions.
Tic Tac Toe Game:

A console-based game where two players alternate turns, entering positions on a 3x3 grid.
Features input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves.
Detects wins based on rows, columns, or diagonals and handles draws.

Features
Real-time board updates after each move.
Detection of winning combinations.
Input validation for correct values and preventing duplicates.
Full board checks for a draw.

Caesar Cipher:

A simple Caesar Cipher encryption tool.
Allows users to input a message and specify a shift value to encrypt the message.
Handles both left (negative) and right (positive) shifts for character encoding.

Features
Supports upper-case letters.
Handles spaces in the message.
Allows both positive and negative shifts.

Technologies
Python: All projects are implemented using Python.
Future Enhancements
Add decryption functionality to the Caesar Cipher tool.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for both projects.
Introduce AI for single-player mode in Tic Tac Toe.
